added patch from Planplan:

allows Helmet, Cloak, Body Armor and Belt to add Arm Strength,
Dexterity, Leg Strength and Agility. It's maybe a bit dirty, but it
work.

The enchant bonus is divised by 2, because the bonus value is added to
each arm or leg. A +1 Dexterity bonus will add +0.5 Dexterity to each
arm so (could be invisible for a +1 item so, unless you're Dexterity is
already a bit trained).


new character field:
AllowedDungeons == ALL_DUNGEONS; // example: AllowedDungeons = { 2, UNDER_WATER_TUNNEL, MONDEDR; }
