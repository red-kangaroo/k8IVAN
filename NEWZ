added patch from Planplan:

allows Helmet, Cloak, Body Armor and Belt to add Arm Strength,
Dexterity, Leg Strength and Agility. It's maybe a bit dirty, but it
work.

The enchant bonus is divised by 2, because the bonus value is added to
each arm or leg. A +1 Dexterity bonus will add +0.5 Dexterity to each
arm so (could be invisible for a +1 item so, unless you're Dexterity is
already a bit trained).


new character field:
AllowedDungeons == ALL_DUNGEONS; // example: AllowedDungeons = { 2, UNDER_WATER_TUNNEL, MONDEDR; }


new room field:
AllowedDivineMasters = { 3, CLEPTIA, SCABIES, CRUENTUS; }
will be used for random altars
room with altar now will have it's divine master autoassigned


the long-awaited array syntax without counters:
name := { item, item, ... }


Level can be taged with
Tag = "arbitrary string";

character can have
LevelTags := { "UT level 0", "UT level 1"; }
to allow spawning only on levels with specified tags. "*" means 'any tag or no tag at all'.

items can have AllowedDungeons and LevelTags too


each monster can have `HomeLevel` array with level tags. this is used to remove unique monsters
from bone file. empty home level means "none", and "*" means "any".
