<h4>Basic syntax structure of the script</h4>

<p>Browsing through he script, you may note that most of the commands
there are of form X { A=B; C=D; E=F; ... }. Let's call this form a <i>structure
definition</i> and the commands A=B; C=D; and so on <i>member value
assignments</i>. In other words, the script consists of <i>structures</i> which
have <i>members</i> to which you can assign <i>values</i>. The order
which you present structure definitions and member value assignments
has usually no relevance. (There are some rare exceptions.) The script also
works whether you divide your script to separate lines or not. You
can also insert extra spaces and tabs between words without changing the
meaning of the script. However, you cannot cut a line or insert
a space or tab inside a word, for instance write "darkmage" as "dark mage".
Even though it is not syntactically necessary, you should follow the
intendation used previously in the script. So write like this:</p>

<pre>
X
{
  A=B;
  C=D;
  E=F;
  ...
}
</pre>

And please avoid intending like this, for instance:

<pre>
X {
A=B;
C=D;
E=F;
...
}
</pre>

<p>Each member of a structure has a <i>type</i>. (Remember "type" also
has another meaning introduced in <a href="lecture1.html">lecture I</a>.
We use the phrases "entity type" and "script member type" to distinguish
between these two meanings, if there's some possibility of confusion.)
The most common are other structures, <i>integers</i>, <i>vectors</i>,
<i>strings</i>, <i>contentscripts</i>
and <i>arrays of elements of a certain type</i>.</p>

<p>Integers are presented like this: 5, 1000000, -532489, 6*527, 5*(-6+62/7)+9
and so on. Division is rounded down. One special class of integers are colors,
which are presented like this: rgb16(100,0,100) or rgb24(255,0,0). These
are functions which transform triples (red,green,blue) into integers.
The elements of these triples are in the range from 0 to 255. So rgb16(0,255,0)
and rgb24(0,255,0) both mean bright green. rgb16 is used for colors of material
coloring and rgb24 is used for lights.</p>

<p>Vectors represent positions in two-dimensional spaces, for instance in
bitmaps or levels. They are presented as X, Y where X and Y are integers.</p>

<p>Any word is a string. So is a phrase surrounded by quotation marks. So
Alfred is a string and so is "Alex the Great", but the words Alex the Great
are three separate strings. It is customary to always use quotation marks to
help readers recognize strings, so you should use "Alfred" instead of Alfred.
You may use the symbols \" to insert a quotation mark inside a string.
Example: "The guard says: \"Buzz off!\"".</p>

<p>Contentscripts are the commands which represent instantiations of entities,
explained in <a href="lecture2.html">lecture II</a>, for instance
OMMEL_HAIR cloak(CLOAK_OF_FIRE_RESISTANCE). There are character, item,
ground terrain and over terrain contentscripts.</p>

<p>An array of elements of a certain type is presented as { n, A, B, C, ..., X; },
where A, B, C, ..., X is a list of n elements which are all of that type. For instance,
let's consider an array of item contentscripts, which are quite common. Let's choose
a structure member of such an array type: the Inventory member of character databases
of char.dat. As an example, here's the basic inventory of Golgor Dhan:</p>

<pre>
    Inventory = { 2, scrollofenchantarmor { Times = 2; }, scrollofenchantweapon { Times = 2; } }
</pre>

<p>Btw, here we learn a new parameter for instantiations, Times. It is a member of
integer type and determines how many times the instantiation is repeated. So the above
script means exactly the same as</p>

<pre>
    Inventory = { 4, scrollofenchantarmor, scrollofenchantarmor, scrollofenchantweapon, scrollofenchantweapon; }
</pre>

<p>Often, you want the array to have only one element. Here's an example:</p>

<pre>
    Square, Random;
    {
      Items == mine(BIG_MINE) { Team = MONSTER_TEAM; IsActive = true; Chance = 50; }
    }
</pre>

<p>This creates a big mine at a random location which is visible to monsters but
not other teams, is active and has 50% chance of appearing. Note that you use the
syntax == X; instead of = { 1, X; }. The latter works also, but is uglier.</p>

<p>A structure may have a member of its own type as a member or member of a member, etc.
This allows recursion. For instance, you can determine the contents of chest as an
array of item contentscripts even though the chest is presented as an item contentscript
itself. Example:</p>

<pre>
  Inventory == itemcontainer(LARGE_CHEST) { ItemsInside == itemcontainer(CHEST) { ItemsInside == itemcontainer(SMALL_CHEST); } }
</pre>

<p>If you add this to the player, he will get a chest inside a chest inside a chest.</p>

<p>Exercise: Suppose the player's bananagrower friends give him a farewell gift at the start
of each journey. That is, a random amount of bananas is generated at the start of the game
in the player's inventory. One banana is always generated. Five to six bananas are most
common. The maximum of ten bananas is generated only rarely. Bananagrowers are generous
to their friends but ten is already a bit too much, as they have to feed their children.
How do you implement this feature using just the script?</p>

<p>Exercise II: Is there any way to have an item appear one time in ten thousand games in
a specific place, using just the script? Answer yes or no. If you answered yes, present an example.</p>
