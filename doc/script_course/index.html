<h3>About script and this course</h3>

<p>This series of documents is aimed at teaching the IVAN community how the IVAN
script works. The basic principle is that the IVAN source code
determines <i>how</i> the world of IVAN and it's various contents,
dungeons, levels, characters, items, materials, etc. are created.
IVAN script, on the other hand, tells <i>what</i> are created.
So when you try to go down from GC7, the script tells the game that
there is a level GC8, what materials its walls are made, what kinds
of rooms it has and if special rooms, for instance a secret vault or an
orc room, are randomly placed there. It also tells that Ivan and
Vladimir must be placed there and that they belong to a unique team.
It knows the equipment, attributes and weapon skills of Ivan. It
commands that the a pile of roubles and vodka bottles must be placed
in his inventory. It contains the basic replies Ivan spits out
when talked to. The source code follows the script's commands
and maked them virtual reality. It also handles the things that
are too difficult to formalize in the simple language of IVAN scripts.
For instance, that Ivan refuses to unequip his Gorovits family
equipment and that he joins the player when the latter is tough
enough are facts that are due to the source code, not the script.</p>

<p>I do not intend to systematically document every feature of the
script system. Rather will I present as much as is needed for fluent
use of script for basic purposes. The order I present these things
is chosen to aid learning, so I will not proceed from the general
to the specific as a systematic documentation would most naturally do.
Instead I often give an example first and the general rule or the dry
table of data later. I think you'll grasp the script easiest by
writing it instead of reading charts and such.</p>
